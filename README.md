# Batch Maker


A recipe CRUD application.

**All recipes are public!**
For now. I will implement private recipes soon.




## Design

I am working on getting this closer to Google's [Material Design specs](https://material.google.com/), but the guidelines for web implementation are sparse, so I need to look elsewhere for inspiration.

The layout works on mobile and required very little tweaking of the desktop design.

## Use

Try the [live demo](https://bearshuford.github.io/8.4-batch-maker/).


Create an account to manage recipes. Adjust servings to make a batch of a different size.
