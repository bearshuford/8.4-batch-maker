# Batch Maker

A recipe CRUD application.

**All recipes are public!**
For now. I will implement private recipes soon.

## Design

I am working on getting this closer to Google's [Material Design specs](https://material.google.com/), but

## Use

Create an account to manage recipes. Adjust servings to make a batch of a different size.


## Built With

* [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/) - user interfaces
* [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/) - models and routing
* [material-ui](http://www.material-ui.com/) - React components that implement Google's Material Design
* [formsy-react](https://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react) - dynamic forms



* [Parse Server](https://parse.com/) - server for recipes & users
* [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) - server hosting


## TODO
[ ] **private recipes**
[ ] **recipe editing**
